# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Multi-layer Neural Network

This project implements a multi-layer neural network architecture optimized for handwritten digit recognition. The architecture incorporates ReLU activation functions for hidden layers and softmax for the output layer.

## Features

- Implemented a multi-layer neural network with ReLU activation for hidden layers and softmax for output.
- Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing for efficient dataset preparation.
- Achieved an accuracy of 95%+ in recognizing handwritten digits, as evaluated by cross-validation testing.
